# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Tkinter
In this project ,I created three models - Random forest regressor ,decision tree regressor and gradient boosting regressor to train on 25K lines of housing data. I used 3 models so that we can compare which suits the best for our data in terms of accuracy or prediction of prices.
